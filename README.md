    This is an API built using express in node.js, and focuses on testing each endpoint and the overall function of the server.

    - POST/ todos- Post a todo items
    - GET/ todos- Get a specific todo items
    - PUT/ todos- Update a specific todo items
    - DELETE/ todos- Delete a todo item

### Models
    a Todo Schema using Mongoose that creates an object model to apply the mongoose schema


### Routes
    The routes defines the routes and calls the router using express


### Server.js
    Connects to the server using Mongoose, and Mongodb and uses the route for the process.env file and calls the port

### App.js
    Uses the express server and connects to the routes

### Tests

    - POST/ todos- Post a todo items
    - GET/ todos- Get a specific todo items
